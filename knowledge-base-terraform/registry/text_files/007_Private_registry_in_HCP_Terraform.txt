Private registry in HCP Terraform
The Terraform Registry at
registry.terraform.io
is public, but many organizations use modules, providers, or Sentinel policies that cannot or do not need to be publicly available.
You can load private modules
directly from version control and other sources
, but those methods do not support
version constraints
or a browsable marketplace, both of which are important for enabling a producers-and-consumers content model in a large organization. You will benefit from a private registry if your teams need access to a common set of providers, modules, or policies.
HCP Terraform Private Registry
HCP Terraform
includes a
private registry
that is available to all accounts, including free organizations. Unlike the public registry, the private registry can import modules and providers from your private VCS repositories on any of HCP Terraform's supported VCS providers. It also lets you upload and manage private, custom providers through the HCP Terraform API and curate a list of commonly-used public providers and modules.
You can seamlessly
reference private modules and providers
in your Terraform configurations, and the HCP Terraform UI provides a searchable marketplace to help users find the components they need.
Other Private Registries
Terraform can use versioned modules from any service that implements
the registry API
.
The Terraform Community edition project does not provide a server implementation, but
we welcome community members to create their own private registries by following
the published protocol.
