HashiCorp Associate Certification exams consist of multiple choice, multiple answer, true/false, and text match
question types. Below are some example questions to introduce you to the question format you will encounter on the exam.
The exam questions are not intended to trick you.
The exam tests your knowledge of Terraform, not how well you spell or how good you are at identifying obscure details.
