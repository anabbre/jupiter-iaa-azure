HCP Terraform runs Terraform operations and stores state remotely, so you can use Terraform without worrying about the stability of your local machine, or the security of your state file.
To use HCP Terraform from the command line, you must log in. Logging in allows you to trigger remote plans and runs, migrate state to the cloud, and perform other remote operations on configurations with HCP Terraform.
Prerequisites
The
Terraform CLI
(version 1.1.0+) installed locally
An
HCP Terraform
account
Tip
If you are using an older version of Terraform, set up a
CLI configuration file
to authenticate to HCP Terraform.
Start the
login
flow
In order to authenticate with HCP Terraform, run the
terraform login
subcommand. Respond
yes
to the prompt to confirm that you want to authenticate.
$
terraform login
Terraform will request an API token for app.terraform.io using your browser.
If login is successful, Terraform will store the token in plain text in
the following file for use by subsequent commands:
/Users/redacted/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
Do you want to proceed?
Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
Enter a value: yes
Generate a token
A browser window will automatically open to the HCP Terraform login screen. Enter a token name in the web UI, or leave the default name,
terraform login
.
Tip
If your browser does not open automatically, navigate to the URL output in your terminal or
click here
to go to the token creation UI.
Click
Create API token
to generate the authentication token.
Save a copy of the token in a secure location. It provides access to your HCP Terraform organization. Terraform will also store your token locally at the file path specified in the command output.
Add the token to the CLI
When the Terraform CLI prompts you, paste the user token exactly once into your terminal. Terraform will hide the token for security when you paste it into your terminal. Press
Enter
to complete the authentication process.
Terraform must now open a web browser to the tokens page for app.terraform.io.
If a browser does not open this automatically, open the following URL to proceed:
https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens?source=terraform-login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generate a token using your browser, and copy-paste it into this prompt.
Terraform will store the token in plain text in the following file
for use by subsequent commands:
/Users/redacted/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json
Token for app.terraform.io:
Enter a value:
Retrieved token for user redacted
