Publish to the Terraform registry
Learn how to publish Terraform providers, modules, and policies to the public Terraform registry.
The
Terraform Registry
is an interactive resource for discovering a wide selection of integrations (providers), configuration packages (modules), and security rules (policies) for use with Terraform. The Registry includes solutions developed by HashiCorp, third-party vendors, and our Terraform community. Our goal with the Registry is to provide plugins to manage any infrastructure API, pre-made modules to quickly configure common infrastructure components, and examples of how to write quality Terraform code.
The Terraform Registry is integrated
directly into Terraform
so you can directly specify providers and modules. Anyone can publish and consume providers, modules, and policies on the public
Terraform Registry
. To publish private modules within your organization, you can use a
private registry
or
reference repositories and other sources directly
.
Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the Terraform Registry.
Navigating the Registry
The registry has a number of different categories for modules, providers, and policies to help with navigating the large number of available options. Select a provider or module card to learn more, filter results to a
specific tier
, or use the search field at the top of the Registry. Search supports keyboard navigation.
