Terraform Enterprise
Terraform Enterprise is HashiCorp's self-hosted distribution of
HCP Terraform

HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise are different distributions of the same application. When this documentation refers to HCP Terraform, the information applies to Terraform Enterprise unless specifically stated otherwise.

Before mid-2019, we referred to all distributions of HCP Terraform as Terraform Enterprise, and the self-hosted distribution as Private Terraform Enterprise (PTFE). These older names sometimes appear in supporting tools, like the
