HCP Terraform Agents
HCP Terraform agents let you manage isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure while keeping your network secure.
Note:
Your HCP Terraform plan determines the number of agents you can use. Refer to
HCP Terraform pricing
for details.
HCP Terraform Agents allow HCP Terraform to communicate with isolated, private, or on-premises infrastructure. By deploying lightweight agents within a specific network segment, you can establish a simple connection between your environment and HCP Terraform, facilitating provisioning and management operations. This is useful for on-premises infrastructure types such as vSphere, Nutanix, OpenStack, enterprise networking providers, and any systems in a protected enclave.
Hands-on:
Try the

tutorial.
The agent requires only outbound connectivity to HCP Terraform, enabling private networks to remain secure. No special networking configuration or exceptions are typically needed.
