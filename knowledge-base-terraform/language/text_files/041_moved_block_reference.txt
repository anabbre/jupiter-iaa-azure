A

moved
The
moved
block specifies the previous address and the new address for the resource. The following table describes the arguments you can set in the
moved
block.
Argument
Description
Type
Required
from
Specifies a resource's previous address. The syntax allows Terraform to select modules, resources, and resources inside child modules.
string
required
to
Specifies the new address to relocate the resource to. The syntax allows Terraform to select modules, resources, and resources inside child modules.
string
required
Before creating a new plan for the resource specified in the
to
field, Terraform checks the state for an existing object at the address specified in the
from
field. Terraform renames existing objects to the string specified in the
to
field and then creates a plan. The plan directs Terraform to provision the resource specified in the
from
field as the resource specified in the
to
field. As a result, Terraform does not destroy the resource during the Terraform run.
Example
The following example moves an AWS instance from address
aws_instance.a
to
aws_instance.b
:
moved
{
from
=
aws_instance.a
to
=
aws_instance.b
}
