Terraform Plugin SDKv2
Maintain plugins built on the legacy SDK.
Terraform Plugin SDKv2 is a way to maintain Terraform Plugins on
protocol version 5
.
We recommend using the
framework
to develop new provider functionality because it offers significant advantages as compared to the SDKv2. We also recommend migrating existing providers to the framework when possible. Refer to
Plugin Framework Benefits
for higher level details about how the framework makes provider development easier and
Plugin Framework Features
for a detailed functionality comparison between the SDKv2 and the framework.
Maintain Existing Providers
Try the
Call APIs with Custom Providers
tutorials.
Clone the
terraform-provider-scaffolding
template repository on GitHub.
Review the SDKv2 documentation for key concepts such as
Schemas
and
Resources
.
Debug and Test
Learn how to
debug your provider
using either logging calls or a debugging tool.
Write
acceptance and unit tests
for your provider.
Migrate, Combine, or Translate
Use the
framework migration guide
to migrate existing providers from SDKv2 to the framework. You can use
terraform-plugin-mux
to migrate individual resources and data sources slowly over time.
Combine your provider
with other
protocol version 5
providers.
Translate your provider
into a
protocol version 6
provider to require Terraform 1.0 and later or to combine with a framework provider and use protocol version 6 exclusive functionality such as nested attributes.
