Terraform CLI Documentation
Hands-on:
Try the
Terraform: Get Started
collection on HashiCorp Learn.
This is the documentation for Terraform CLI. It is relevant to anyone working
with Terraform's CLI-based workflows; this includes people who use Terraform CLI
by itself, as well as those who use Terraform CLI in conjunction with Terraform
Cloud or Terraform Enterprise.
Notably, this documentation does not cover the syntax and usage of the Terraform
language. For that, see the
Terraform Language Documentation
.
