Govern Terraform
As your teams grow, a common operational challenge is deciding how to enforce your organization's standards and practices. Using codified, automated policy enforcement with Sentinel or OPA ensures consistent application of your standards.
Govern infrastructure through policy
You can use policy as code to ensure your infrastructure meets your organization's security, governance, and cost requirements. You can configure your workflows to automatically run policy checks as part of your Terraform operations and set conditions for how to handle policy failures. Soft enforcement lets prompts a user to approve an operation that fails a policy check, and hard enforcement blocks the operation entirely.
You can define policies that set standards for both your infrastructure configuration itself, and for the workflows around configuration deployment. Some examples of policy rules you can define include which ports are open in a firewall, the permitted sizes of virtual machines, or that deployments cannot take place on Fridays. In HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise you can use either
OPA
or
Sentinel
for your policy definitions.
